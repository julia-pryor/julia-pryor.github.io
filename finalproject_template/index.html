    <div class="byline">By Julia Pryor</div>

      <p> Growing up, I was always described as a “bookworm.” I spent every day reading anything and everything I could get my hands on and always left school with a stack of books in my backpack. I reveled in storytimes, counted down the days until the Scholastic Book Fair, and began writing my own stories as soon as I could hold a pencil. The books I read opened my mind to new possibilities. They taught me about realities outside my own, helped me discover myself, and meaningfully shaped my worldview.  </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, many K-12 students across the United States face a different reality than I did. Their school libraries ban books, most frequently ones that explore sexuality and gender, or tackle difficult subjects like racism and homophobia. These students are unable to engage with progressive texts that have the power to change the ideologies of their generation. They’re unable to learn about realities outside their own, discover different aspects of their identity, or think critically and form their own opinions. </p>

      <p> As more and more book bans have been reported on the news, I became curious about the reasoning behind certain bans. I wondered if some books were unfairly banned or if biases were a factor in their banning. In an attempt to find an answer to these questions, I stumbled upon <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-IAIMTebzxhAcme-uAHcxY5Toz_m49AzzPkpD0cB0Ow/edit?usp=sharing"> PEN America’s Index of School Book Bans</a>. PEN America is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-IAIMTebzxhAcme-uAHcxY5Toz_m49AzzPkpD0cB0Ow/edit?usp=sharing"> “works to defend and celebrate free expression in the United States and worldwide through the advancement of literature and human rights.”</a> Their index lists instances where students’ access to books in school libraries and classrooms in the U.S. was restricted or diminished for either limited or indefinite periods of time, from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. It contains the book’s name and author, the school district, the month of challenge or removal, the origin of the challenge, and the type of ban.</p>

    <div class="visual"> <iframe title= "Most Frequently Banned Books in U.S. Schools 2021-2022" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Dy7PL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Dy7PL/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="255"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
</div>

      <p>Through my analysis of the index, I found that each of the top six most banned books contains content about sexuality, gender, race, or discrimination. In the most-banned book, <em>Gender Queer: A Memoir</em>, Maia Kobabe explores sexuality and gender identity from adolescence to adulthood. In <em>All Boys Aren’t Blue</em>, George M. Johnson describes growing up as a queer, black man in New Jersey and Virginia. In <em>The Hate U Give</em>, Angie Thomas writes about a teenage girl’s experience grappling with racism, police brutality, and activism after witnessing her black friend murdered by the police. Out of Darkness, The Bluest Eye, and Lawn Boy also all center around minority characters experiencing a phase of self-discovery. At this point in my analysis, I determined that bias was a serious issue in these book bans.</p>

    <div class="visual"> <iframe title="Most Banned Authors in U.S. Schools" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-1WA0F" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1WA0F/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
</div>

      <p>Then, I analyzed the index by the author to determine if there was a similar pattern of bias against a writer’s identity. Unsurprisingly, three of the five most-banned authors were people of color or members of the LGBT+ community. Maia Kobabe, author of <em>Gender Queer: A Memoir</em>, identifies as non-binary and asexual; George M. Johnson, author of <em>All Boys Aren’t Blue</em>, is black and identifies as non-binary; and Toni Morrison, the author of <em>The Bluest Eye</em>, was black. With the majority of bans being against authors writing about their experiences as minorities, it became clear to me that the book bans were to censor the authors and discourage other writers from publishing similar progressive texts.</p>

    <div class="visual"> <iframe title="States that Banned the Most Books in 2021-2022" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-IG92q" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IG92q/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="541" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
</div>

      <p>This made me curious if certain states banned books more frequently than others and if the state’s political affiliation could have anything to do with it. When I analyzed the index by state, I found that book bans occurred the most frequently in Texas, with 801 bans originating from the state just last school year. Other states that frequently banned hundreds of books last school year include Florida, Tennessee, and Oklahoma, which are all majority Republican states. Of the top five states that banned the most books, Pennsylvania is the only one that is majority Democratic.</p>

    <div class="visual"> <iframe title="School Districts that Banned the Most Books in 2021-2022" aria-label="Column  Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-r2BBJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r2BBJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="394" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
</div>

      <p>When I analyzed the index by the school district, I noticed the same pattern in my findings. School districts belonging to historically Republican states reported the most book bans, except for the Central York School District in the Democratic state of Pennsylvania, which banned a whopping 441 books last school year. The surge of book bans in Republican states has led many parents to form organizations such as the <a href="https://www.fftrp.org/">Freedom to Read Project in Florida</a> in protest. Stephana Ferrell, one of the founders of Freedom to Read, encourages concerned parents and readers to document bans as they occur and work against the censorship movement.</p>
      
      <p>With the increase in book bans in schools across the United States, I think it’s more important now than ever to stand up against censorship. As a child, books were my refuge where I could escape into new worlds. Reading progressive texts helped me better understand myself and those around me and taught me that being different isn’t bad. Today’s youth will miss out on those essential lessons if we don’t resist censorship and end book bans.</p>
